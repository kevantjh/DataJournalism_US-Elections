# Data Journalism Project - U.S. Presidential Elections

# Scenario
You are a data journalist for a political magazine, and you have been asked to create a
graphic feature for the online version of the magazine. Your editor wants you to look
back at the Presidential elections so far in the 21st century and tell a story about them.
You have 1.5 days to create the story as it needs to be published in time for the next
edition, and you need to present your story at the editorial meeting before it can be
published.

# Data

# Questions
Here are a few questions that we may want to investigate:
1. Who has been the most voted for President in the 21st century?
2. Can you create a map showing election results so that you can choose which
year’s results to show and when you hover over a county you
can see how many votes were cast there?
3. Can you create a map showing election results so that you can choose which
year’s results to show, and each county is colored according to
what % of Republican or Democrat vote was received there?
4. Which states are the most loyal to their party? And which counties?
5. Which states have remained loyal to their party throughout all elections? And
which counties? Which are the least loyal?
6. Can you create an animation showing results over time per state, and how they
have changed?
